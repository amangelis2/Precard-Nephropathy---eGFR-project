# Precard eGFR Type 2 Latent Class Models project repository.
 
This repository contains code that encompasses loading, cleaning, imputing, analyzing, and visualizing data from the eGFR Data Cleaning project, 
with a specific focus on patients with type 2 diabetes. 
The project aims to prepare data, create additional datasets suitable for longitudinal analysis, conduct comprehensive analysis, and generate visualizations.

## Project Overview

The project is organized into the following parts:

### 01_Precard_DTII_Imputation

In this section, data specific to patients with type 2 diabetes is prepared. Data cleaning, imputation, and necessary preprocessing are performed to ensure the data is ready for further analysis.

### 02_Precard_LCM_Dataset_Preparation

This section involves the creation of datasets suitable for longitudinal analysis. The datasets are tailored to capture the necessary information for latent class modeling and other longitudinal techniques.

### 03_Precard_LCM_Models

Here, the latent class models (LCMs) are constructed and analyzed. 
These models provide insights into underlying subpopulations within the type 2 diabetes patient data, 
offering a deeper understanding of eGFR dynamics and related factors.

### 03a_Precard_LCM_results

This section contains the results of the latent class models. 
The analysis outcomes, model statistics, and visualizations are presented to provide a comprehensive view of the findings.
